# task 3

a = 1 
print (a) 
print (a+a) 
print('a is asigned a number and hence the operation a+a was mathematical addition and o/p was 2')
b = '1' 
print (b) 
print (b+b)
print('b is asigned a string/ non numeric character and so when added b+b it simply concatenated the two charachers asigned to b')

#a is asigned a number and hence the operation 'a+a' was mathematical addition and o/p was 2
#b is asigned a string/ non numeric character and so when added b+b it simply concatenated the two charachers asigned to b
